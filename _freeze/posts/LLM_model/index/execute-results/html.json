These questions are intentionally designed to be high-quality and extremely difficult.\n\nExpert Accuracy: Even experts who hold or are pursuing PhDs in the corresponding domains achieve only 65% accuracy on these questions (or 74% when excluding clear mistakes identified in retrospect).\n\nGoogle-Proof: The questions are \"Google-proof,\" meaning that even with unrestricted access to the web, highly skilled non-expert validators only reach an accuracy of 34% despite spending over 30 minutes searching for answers.\n\nAI Systems Difficulty: State-of-the-art AI systems, including our strongest GPT-4 based baseline, achieve only 39% accuracy on this challenging dataset.\n\n# SimpleBench\n\nhttps://simple-bench.com/\n\n![](images/clipboard-1311795434.png)\n# Compare online\n\n\nhttps://lmarena.ai/",
