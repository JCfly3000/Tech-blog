```




# using version

upload two data to mtcars with version control

```{r}
board %>% pin_write(tail(mtcars), "mtcars_version",versioned = TRUE)
board %>% pin_write(head(mtcars), "mtcars_version",versioned = TRUE)
```

## there will be two version

```{r}
board %>% pin_versions("mtcars_version")
```

## download version file from board

```{r}
# board %>% pin_read("mtcars_version",version = '20230704T095208Z-8df40')
board %>% pin_read("mtcars_version",version = .Last.value$version[[1]])
