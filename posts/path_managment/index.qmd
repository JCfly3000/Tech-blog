A guide to managing file paths in R and Python, with a focus on the `fs` and `here` packages in R.

This document addresses the common challenge of managing file paths across different operating systems, such as Windows and Mac. It provides a guide to using dedicated packages in R and Python to handle file paths in a robust and reproducible way. The R section focuses on the `fs` package for a wide range of file system operations and the `here` package for creating project-relative paths that work seamlessly across different environments. The Python section is a placeholder for future content.

Since windows and mac have different file path, we use package to manage the file path.

# R

## fs pacakge

```{r}
#pak::pkg_install('here')
#pak::pkg_install('fs')
library(fs)
```


```{r}
getwd()
```

### list file in the current directory

```{r}
dir_ls()
```


### show the current directory file info

```{r}
dir_info()
```


### show the current directory file tree

```{r}
dir_tree()
```


### create a new temp directory

```{r}
# create a new directory
tmp <- dir_create(file_temp())
tmp
```

### create new files in that directory

```{r}
# create new files in that directory
file_create(path(tmp, "my-file.txt"))
dir_ls(tmp)
```

### remove files from the directory

```{r}
# remove files from the directory
file_delete(path(tmp, "my-file.txt"))
dir_ls(tmp)
```


### remove the directory

```{r}
# remove the directory
dir_delete(tmp)
```


## here package

```{r}
library(here)
```



### show project directory
```{r}
here()
```

### show all file in the project directory
```{r}
list.files(here())
```


### show one file path

image_path=here('posts/path_managment/images','here.png')
