An introduction to `lintr` and `styler` for R code optimization, with examples of how to use them for static code analysis and formatting.

This document introduces two essential R packages for code optimization: `lintr` and `styler`. It explains how `lintr` performs static code analysis to help you identify and fix style inconsistencies, syntax errors, and other potential issues in your R code. The document also demonstrates how `styler` can automatically format your code to adhere to the tidyverse style guide, ensuring consistency and readability. You'll find practical examples of how to use both packages to improve the quality of your R code.

# lintr

{lintr} provides static code analysis for R. It checks for adherence to a given style, identifying syntax errors and possible semantic issues, then reports them to you so you can take action. Watch lintr in action in the following animation:


https://github.com/r-lib/lintr


```{r}
pak::pkg_install("lintr")
```

```{r}
library(lintr)
```


```{r}
lint("
a = 123
    c=5
")
```

```{r}
lint("test.R")
```



# styler


styler formats your code according to the tidyverse style guide (or your custom style guide) so you can direct your attention to the content of your code. It helps to keep the coding style consistent across projects and facilitate collaboration. You can access styler through

https://github.com/r-lib/styler



```{r}
pak::pkg_install("styler")
```


```{r}
library(styler)
```

```{r}
style_text("

a = 3

small_Car='Toyota'
Big=330


")
```

## Before


```{r}
#| eval: false
library("dplyr")

   Good <- 1
applePie <- Good + 1
    Peter <- d + 1

```



## Auto formating

```{r filename="test.R"}
style_file("test.R")
```
After

```{r}
#| eval: false
library("dplyr")

Good <- 1
applePie <- Good + 1
Peter <- d + 1

```
